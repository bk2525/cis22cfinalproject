only wanted have fun Learning fly learning run let heart decide way When was young Deep down must have always known That this would be inevitable earn stripes have pay bare soul know not only one Who regrets things done Sometimes just feel its only Who cant stand reflection that they see wish could live little more Look up sky not just floor feel like life flashing by all can do watch cry miss air miss friends miss mother miss when Life was party be thrown that was million years ago When walk around all streets Where grew up found feet They cant look eye Its like theyre scared try think things say Like joke memory they dont recognise now light day know not only one Who regrets things done Sometimes just feel its only Who never became who they thought theyd be wish could live little more Look up sky not just floor feel like life flashing by all can do watch cry miss air miss friends miss mother miss when Life was party be thrown that was million years ago million years ago
