Everybody loves things do From way talk way move Everybody here watching Cause feel like home like dream come true chance here alone Can have moment before go Cause been myself all night long Hoping someone used know look like movie sound like song God this reminds when were young Let photograph this light case last time That might be exactly like were Before realized were sad getting old made us restless was just like movie was just like song was scared face fears Nobody told that youd be here And swear moved overseas Thats what said when left still look like movie still sound like song God this reminds when were young Let photograph this light case last time That might be exactly like were Before realized were sad getting old made us restless was just like movie was just like song When were young When were young When were young When were young Its hard admit that Everything just takes back when were there when were there And part keeps holding on Just case hasnt gone guess still care Do still care was just like movie was just like song God this reminds when were young When were young When were young When were young When were young Let photograph this light case last time That might be exactly like were Before realized were sad getting old made us restless mad getting old makes reckless was just like movie was just like song When were young
