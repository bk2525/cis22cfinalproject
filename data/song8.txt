Easy On Me
There aint no gold this river That been washin my hands forever know there hope these waters cant bring myself swim When drowning this silence Baby let Go easy baby was still child Didnt get chance Feel world around had no time choose What chose do go easy There aint no room for things change When we are both deeply stuck our ways cant deny how hard tried changed who was put both first now give up Go easy baby was still child Didnt get chance Feel world around Had no time choose What chose do go easy had good intentions highest hopes know right now probably doesnt even show Go easy baby was still child didnt get chance Feel world around had no time choose What chose do go easy
