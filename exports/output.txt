 Title: Rolling in the Deep
  Year: 2011
 Album: 21
Lyrics: There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and
        it's bringing me out the dark Finally, I can see you crystal
        clear Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare See
        how I'll leave with every piece of you Don't underestimate the
        things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark The
        scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinking that we
        almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me
        breathless I can't help feeling We could've had it all (You're
        gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are
        gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your
        hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me) And you played it
        to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I
        have no story to be told But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna
        make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair
        Making home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (You're
        gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind
        me of us (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep
        me thinking that we almost had it all (You're gonna wish you
        never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me
        breathless (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't
        help feeling We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never
        had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling
        in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna
        wish you never had met me) And you played it to the beat (Tears
        are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could've had it all
        Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand But you
        played it with a beating Throw your soul through every open door
        Count your blessings to find what you look for Turn my sorrow
        into treasured gold You pay me back in kind and reap just what
        you sow (You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had
        it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could've
        had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) It all, it
        all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We
        could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you
        never had met me) And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna
        fall, rolling in the deep) Could've had it all (You're gonna
        wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna
        fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it You
        played it You played it You played it to the beat

 Album: 25
Lyrics: Take your eyes off of me so I can leave I'm far too ashamed to
        do it with you watching me This is never ending, we have been
        here before But I can't stay this time, 'cause I don't love you
        anymore Please, stay where you are Don't come any closer Don't
        try to change my mind I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love
        you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so
        much space between us Baby, we're already defeated
        Ay-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah Everything changed me You
        have given me something that I can't live without You mustn't
        underestimate that when you are in doubt But I don't want to
        carry on like everything is fine The longer we ignore it, all
        the more that we will fight Please, don't fall apart I can't
        face your breaking heart I'm trying to be brave Stop asking me
        to stay I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans
        apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already
        defeated Ay-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah Everything
        changed me We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing Every
        word I've said, you know I'll always mean It is the world to me
        that you are in my life But I want to live and not just survive
        That's why I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're
        oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're
        already defeated 'Cause, ay-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
        Everything changed me And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

        crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At Skyfall At
        Skyfall Skyfall is where we start A thousand miles and poles
        apart Where worlds collide and days are dark You may have my
        number, you can take my name But you'll never have my heart Let
        the sky fall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles (when it
        crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face it all

        it all together At Skyfall Where you go, I go What you see, I
        see I know I'd never be me Without the security Of your loving
        arms Keeping me from harm Put your hand in my hand And we'll
        stand Let the sky fall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles (when
        it crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face it all
        together Let the sky fall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles
        (when it crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face

        all been said before, you know So why don't we just play pretend

        me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this
        ends Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
        It's already in your eyes And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for
        me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one
        that matters Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong I
        know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night
        with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a
        memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
        It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again? Let
        this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I
        don't wanna be cruel or vicious And I ain't asking for
        forgiveness All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold
        me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use
        Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how
        this ends Cause what if I never love again?

Lyrics: I let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It
        was dark, and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved
        me My hands, they were strong But my knees were far too weak To
        stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But there's a
        side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you'd
        say They were never true, never true And the games you'd play
        You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
        Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I
        cried 'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name Your name When I
        lay with you I could stay there, close my eyes Feel you here
        forever You and me together, nothing is better 'Cause there's a
        side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you'd
        say They were never true, never true And the games you'd play
        You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
        Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I
        cried 'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name Your name I set
        fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames When we fell,
        something died 'Cause I knew that that was the last time The
        last time Sometimes, I wake up by the door That heart you caught
        must be waiting for ya Even now, when we're already over I can't
        help myself from looking for ya I set fire to the rain Watched
        it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried
        'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name Your name I set fire
        to the rain And I threw us into the flames When we fell,
        something died 'Cause I knew that that was the last time The
        last time, oh Oh, no Let it burn, oh Let it burn Let it burn

        get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to
        choose What I chose to do So go easy on me There ain't no room
        for things to change When we are both so deeply stuck in our
        ways You can't deny how hard I've tried I changed who I was to
        put you both first But now I give up Go easy on me, baby I was
        still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me
        Had no time to choose What I chose to do So go easy on me I had
        good intentions And the highest hopes But I know right now It
        probably doesn't even show Go easy on me, baby I was still a
        child I didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me I had
        no time to choose What I chose to do So go easy on me

Lyrics: I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and
        you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she
        gave you things, I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so
        shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate
        to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away,
        I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd
        be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find
        someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't
        forget me, " I beg I remember you said "Sometimes it lasts in
        love, but sometimes it hurts instead" "Sometimes it lasts in
        love, but sometimes it hurts instead" You know how the time
        flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and
        raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days
        I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay
        away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that
        you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll
        find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too
        "Don't forget me, " I begged I remember you said "Sometimes it
        lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" Nothing compares,
        no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
        Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never
        mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for
        you "Don't forget me, " I beg I remember you said "Sometimes it
        lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" Never mind, I'll
        find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too
        "Don't forget me, " I begged I remember you said "Sometimes it
        lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" "Sometimes it
        lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

 Title: Million Years Ago
  Year: 2015
 Album: 25
Lyrics: I only wanted to have fun Learning to fly learning to run I let
        my heart decide the way When I was young Deep down I must have
        always known That this would be inevitable To earn my stripes
        I'd have to pay And bare my soul I know I'm not the only one Who
        regrets the things they've done Sometimes I just feel it's only
        me Who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could
        live a little more Look up to the sky not just the floor I feel
        like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I
        miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother, I miss it when
        Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago
        When I walk around all of the streets Where I grew up and found
        my feet They can't look me in the eye It's like they're scared
        of me I try to think of things to say Like a joke or a memory
        But they don't recognise me now In the light of day I know I'm
        not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes I
        just feel it's only me Who never became who they thought they'd
        be I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky not just
        the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is
        watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my
        mother, I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that
        was a million years ago A million years ago

Lyrics: Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk To the
        way you move And everybody here is watching you 'Cause you feel
        like home You're like a dream come true But if by chance you're
        here alone Can I have a moment Before I go? 'Cause I've been by
        myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You
        look like a movie You sound like a song My God, this reminds me
        Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In
        case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were
        Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us
        restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was
        so scared to face my fears 'Cause nobody told me that you'd be
        here And I swear you moved overseas That's what you said, when
        you left me You still look like a movie You still sound like a
        song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me
        photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we
        might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of
        getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was
        just like a song (When we were young) (When we were young) (When
        we were young) (When we were young) It's hard to admit that
        Everything just takes me back To when you were there To when you
        were there And a part of me keeps holding on Just in case it
        hasn't gone I guess I still care Do you still care? It was just
        like a movie It was just like a song My God, this reminds me Of
        when we were young (When we were young) (When we were young)
        (When we were young) (When we were young) Let me photograph you
        in this light In case it is the last time That we might be
        exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting
        old It made us restless Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old It makes
        me reckless It was just like a movie It was just like a song
        When we were young

Lyrics: When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on
        your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my
        love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is
        no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million
        years To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind
        up yet But I will never do you wrong I've known it from the
        moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I'd go
        hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawling down the avenue
        No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love
        The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of
        regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't
        seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your
        dreams come true Nothing that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of
        the Earth for you To make you feel my love To make you feel my

        been trying my whole life to solve God only knows how I've cried
        I can't take another defeat A next time would be the ending of

        cruel thing (Cruel thing) To self-inflict that pain Love is a
        game for fools to play And I ain't fooling again (Fooling) What
        a cruel thing (Cruel thing) To self-inflict that pain No amount
        of love Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied) I can't
        keep up (I can't keep up, I can't keep up) When I keep changing
        my mind (Change my mind, change my mind) The feelings flood me
        to the heights of no compromise Love is a game for fools to play
        And I ain't fooling (Fooling) What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
        To self-inflict that pain Love is a game for fools to play And I
        ain't fooling (Fooling) What a cruel thing (Cruel thing) To
        self-inflict that pain Oh you know, I'd do it all again I love
        it now like I loved it then I'm a fool for that You know I'm,
        you know I'm gonna do it Oh-oh-oh-oh I'd do it all again, like I
        did then

 Title: Hello 
  Year: 2015
 Album: 25
Lyrics: Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd
        like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed
        to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear
        me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we
        were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the
        world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And
        a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a
        thousand times To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've
        done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the
        outside At least I can say that I've tried To tell you I'm sorry
        for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't
        tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me
        to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you
        ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened? It's
        no secret that the both of us Are running out of time So hello
        from the other side (other side) I must've called a thousand
        times (thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that
        I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from
        the outside (outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've
        tried) To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it
        don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore Ooh
        (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs)
        Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore (Highs, highs, highs,
        highs) Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore (Highs, highs,
        highs, highs) Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows) Hello from the
        other side (other side) I must've called a thousand times
        (thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've
        done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the
        outside (outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've
        tried) To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it
        don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Lyrics: I've been walking in the same way as I did Missing out the
        cracks in the pavement And turning my heel and strutting my feet
        "Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there anyone I
        could call?" "No and thank you, please Madam I ain't lost, just
        wandering" 'Round my hometown Memories are fresh 'Round my
        hometown Ooh the people I've met Are the wonders of my world Are
        the wonders of my world Are the wonders of this world Are the
        wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick
        and opaque I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and
        shades I like it in the city when two worlds collide You get the
        people and the government Everybody taking different sides Shows
        that we ain't gonna stand shit Shows that we are united Shows
        that we ain't gonna take it Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
        Shows that we are united 'Round my hometown Memories are fresh
        'Round my hometown Ooh the people I've met yeah
        Do-dily-di-da-da-da-da-day, yeah Do-dily-di-da-da-da-da-day,
