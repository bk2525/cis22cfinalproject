let fall heart fell rose claim was dark was over Until kissed lips saved hands they were strong But knees were far too weak stand in arms Without falling feet But theres a side never knew never knew All things youd say They were never true never true games youd play would always win always win But set fire rain Watched pour touched face Well burned while cried Cause heard screamin out name name lay with could stay there close eyes Feel here forever together nothing better Cause theres a side never knew never knew All things youd say They were never true never true games youd play would always win always win But set fire rain Watched pour touched face Well burned while cried Cause heard screamin out name name set fire rain threw us into flames fell something died Cause knew was last time last time Sometimes wake up by door heart caught must be waiting for ya Even now were already over cant help myself from looking for ya set fire rain Watched pour touched face Well burned while cried Cause heard screamin out name name set fire rain threw us into flames fell something died Cause knew was last time last time no Let burn Let burn Let burn
