will leave heart door wont say word Theyve all been said before know why dont just play pretend Like were not scared what coming next scared having nothing left Look dont get wrong know there no tomorrow All ask this last night Hold like more than just friend Give memory can use Take by hand while do what lovers do matters how this ends Cause what never love again dont need honesty already in eyes sure eyes they speak for No one knows like do since youre only one that matters Tell who do run to Look dont get wrong know there no tomorrow All ask this last night Hold like more than just friend Give memory can use Take by hand while do what lovers do matters how this ends Cause what never love again Let this be our lesson in love Let this be way remember us dont wanna be cruel vicious aint asking for forgiveness All ask this last night Hold like more than just friend Give memory can use Take by hand while do what lovers do matters how this ends Cause what never love again
