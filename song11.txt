When rain blowing face whole world case could offer warm embrace make feel love When evening shadows stars appear there no one there dry tears could hold million years make feel love know havent made mind up yet will never do wrong known from moment that met No doubt mind where belong go hungry go black blue go crawling down avenue No theres nothing that wouldnt do make feel love storms are raging rolling sea highway of regret winds of change are blowing wild free aint seen nothing like me yet could make happy make dreams come true Nothing that wouldnt do Go ends of Earth make feel love make feel love
