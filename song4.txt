Theres fire starting heart Reaching fever pitch bringing out dark Finally can see crystal clear Go head sell out Ill lay shit bare See how leave with every piece Dont underestimate things that will do Theres fire starting heart Reaching fever pitch bringing out dark scars love remind They keep thinking that we almost had all scars love they leave breathless cant help feeling We could have had all Rolling deep had heart inside hand played beat Baby have no story be told But heard one on Im gonna make head burn Think depths despair Making home down there cause mine sure wont be shared scars love remind They keep thinking that we almost had all scars love they leave breathless cant help feeling We could have had all Rolling deep had heart inside hand played beat We couldve had all Rolling deep had heart inside hand But played with beating Throw soul through every open door Count blessings find what look for Turned sorrow into treasured gold pay back kind reap just what sow we couldve had all We couldve had all all all all We could have had all Rolling deep had heart inside hand played beat We couldve had all Rolling deep had heart inside hand But played played played played beat
