heard that settled down That found girl married now heard that dreams came true Guess she gave things didnt give Old friend why are shy Aint like hold back hide from light hate turn up out blue uninvited couldnt stay away couldnt fight had hoped youd see face that youd be reminded that me isnt over Never mind find someone like wish nothing best Dont forget me beg remember said Sometimes lasts love sometimes hurts instead Sometimes lasts love sometimes hurts instead know how time flies Only yesterday was time our lives were born raised summer haze Bound surprise our glory days hate turn up out blue uninvited couldnt stay away couldnt fight had hoped youd see face that youd be reminded that me isnt over Never mind find someone like wish nothing best Dont forget me begged remember said Sometimes lasts love sometimes hurts instead Nothing compares no worries cares Regrets mistakes theyre memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste Never mind find someone like wish nothing best Dont forget me beg remember said Sometimes lasts love sometimes hurts instead Never mind find someone like wish nothing best Dont forget me begged remember said Sometimes lasts love sometimes hurts instead Sometimes lasts love sometimes hurts instead
